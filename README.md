# Mandelbrot

Mandelbrot is a Java application that generates and displays the Mandelbrot Set,
one of the most famous and beautiful fractals. 

Mandelbrot can navigate the fractal, and zoom in down to floating point precision.
A selection of customizable brushes is available to view the fractal in 
different ways.

## Usage

The application is driven by a JavaFX GUI. Simply run the main method in 
Mandelbrot.java to launch Mandelbrot. Use WASD to move the view around and +- to
zoom in and out. Additional control are available in the toolbar on the right.

## Contributing

3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin myFeature`
